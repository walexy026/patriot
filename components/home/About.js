        Over 20 crore Indians still go to sleep on an empty stomach everyday, in
        a world where we are progressing in every way. Hunger no more is
        community of students who want to serve the humanity and help them as
        much as possible. If we could make even a small difference in the lives
        of 1000 people, our goal would be achieved.
        <br />
        Our mission is to Reduce the wastage of food by using it for a good
        cause and provide a healthy meal to kids so that they can sleep with a
        full stomach.

        more benefit of the society. Also, we will combine with mess of all
